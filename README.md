# WeatherPlanar

Hello Visitor! This is my Capstone-Project to show what i have learned in the Web Developement Bootcamp by neue Fische GmbH. 

Therefore I have created the Web-App called "WeatherPlanar", which can be used by Users to keep track of their appointments and other planned activities. 
As a user you can create, edit and delete activities/appointments. On the homepage your activities/appointments will be filtered regarding the recent date. 
In the calendar you can change the date and see your planned activities/appointments for other days. You can check out the recent weather and a forecast for the next three days, too. I achieved this by fetching the API from [WeatherAPI.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/). On the personal page the user can add his name and set his location, which will be given to the api and fetch the weather conditions regarding this location. 

Enough talking! Here you can look at some impressions!
